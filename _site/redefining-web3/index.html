<h1>Redefining Web3</h1>
<p><a href="https://terrenly.com/2023/01/14/web3-is-broken/"><em>Web3 is broken.</em></a></p>

<p>So how do we fix it?</p>

<p>For starters, we need to redefine it.</p>

<p>To recap, what’s actually wrong with Web3? Web3 as a term was coined in 2014 by one of the co-creators of the Ethereum blockchain, Gavin Wood, imagining a decentralized web powered by blockchain, “combining the decentralization of Web 1.0 with the ease of Web 2.0”. This is Web3’s biggest issue – it has an extreme fixation on blockchain. Yes, blockchain is a good piece of tech. But it’s not a catch-all solution for every Web 2.0 problem that Web3 wants to fix.</p>

<p>This view of Web3 as a “blockchain-based web” is incredibly short-sighted. Besides, it seems as though the recent crypto-blockchain-web3 movement has completely forgotten about the *other* time somebody coined the term Web 3.0, that time referring to something else entirely.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to 2009 for a second, to a slideshow created by Tim Berners-Lee, who is widely known for being the inventor of the World Wide Web. In this slideshow, he explains another, entirely separate concept for a user-controlled open-standards based decentralized version of the modern web where Big Tech’s walled gardens would be absent. And what does he call it? Web 3.0.</p>

<p>https://www.w3.org/2009/Talks/0427-web30-tbl</p>

<p>His version of Web 3.0 isn’t based on blockchain. Instead, it relies on a concept known as the Semantic Web — an extension of the World Wide Web in which information is given well-defined meaning, making it easier for computers to understand and process. It’s based on the idea of using a common language (such as RDF and OWL) to describe and link data, so that it can be easily understood and used by machines as well as humans. The goal of the Semantic Web is to create a more intelligent and interconnected web, where data can be easily shared and reused across different applications and systems. For further understanding of what linked data is all about, go to both links above and watch/click through all of it.</p>

<p>Now, hearing a presentation about it and seeing a slideshow all feels really abstract. More recently, Tim Berners-Lee has been working to create an actual implementation of such an idea. Even he shies away from using the term Web 3.0 now, since blockchain folks have so thoroughly appropriated it.</p>

<p>The Solid project, which is a short form for “Social Linked Data”, aims to do exactly this. It’s a web decentralization project formed around this concept of the Semantic Web and linked data. I’m not going to spend too much time explaining Solid when somebody else, namely <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90807852/tim-berners-lee-inrupt-solid-pods">this article</a>, has already done it far better than I can.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to take the rest of this article to focus on some good examples of what web decentralization can look like independently of and alongside ideas like Solid. Let’s go back to Web3’s supposed original goal of “combining the decentralization of Web 1.0 with the ease of Web 2.0”. There are existing technologies out there which are attempting to do this, and the future is bright if we all adopt them instead.</p>

<p>One is the W3C’s own ActivityPub, an open standard for interconnected, federated social networks. The most famous use of the ActivityPub protocol is Mastodon, the microblogging-based social network that recently grew in popularity after Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter. But part of the power of ActivityPub is that even non-Mastodon users can interact with Mastodon over the protocol. Examples include PixelFed — an Instagram alternative for a decentralized web, and PeerTube — YouTube but BitTorrent-based and federated through ActivityPub.</p>

<p>The network of interconnected servers running various ActivityPub-based software is known as the fediverse, and it’s a perfect example of what a good “Web 3.0” project should look like.</p>

<p>Another such protocol is Matrix, a chat protocol for the open web (although while on the subject of open-source chat protocols, I should mention that XMPP/Jabber is still supreme and companies should adopt it again).</p>

<p>This is what a decentralized web should look like. Unfortunately, it’s highly unlikely that given the world’s perception of Web3 at this point, the term can be redefined more generically as a decentralized web.</p>
