<h1>Using Windows Media Center on Windows 10</h1>
<p>Windows Media Center was an application included in most editions of the much loved Windows 7. However, with Windows 7’s end of support, people must upgrade to stay supported. Thing is, newer Windows versions don’t have WMC! For a brief period of time, it could be purchased as an add-on for Windows 8 Pro, but now that’s gone. While WMC wasn’t used much in general, it developed a small but extremely loyal following. If you’re among that following or just want to try WMC on your new PC, fear not. I have a way for you.</p>

<p>Installing &amp; Setting Up WMC</p>

<p>WMC installation itself is pretty easy. You just need to download the installer, run it, and then open it from your Start menu. The current version is WMC 8.8.5, the only version compatible with Windows 10 20H2. Don’t try to look for WMC 13, as although newer, it is incompatible with Win10 20H2. To download it, just click the link below:</p>

<p>https://archive.org/details/wmc-v-8.8.5</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the zip, unzip it to C:WMC. Then, right-click on Installer.cmd, and click “Run as Administrator”. It will then ask you to confirm the operation. Click “Yes”. From there, you just have to watch as the Command Prompt installs WMC. Once WMC is installed, you should find it in your Start Menu like any other app.</p>

<p>From here, setup is simple. WMC, when first launched, has you set it up. From there, you can perform any of the tasks you could perform using WMC before. Note: in the future, I will publish more articles on how to get the most from WMC.</p>
