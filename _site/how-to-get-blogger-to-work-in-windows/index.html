When I mentioned Windows Live Writer, I said that if your blog was on WordPress, then you could use Writer. However, some people may have been confused, because when they opened Windows Live Writer, they may have seen other providers listed. For example, under Other, it said Blogger, Typepad, and more. If you try to add a Blogger blog, however, it gives an error message of User Name or Password is incorrect. This is because Writer uses an sign-in technology which Google no longer supports.

    <p>In my last post, we talked a bit about Windows Essentials. When I mentioned Windows Live Writer, I said that if your blog was on WordPress, then you could use Writer. However, some people may have been confused, because when they opened Windows Live Writer, they may have seen other providers listed. For example, under Other, it said Blogger, Typepad, and more. If you try to add a Blogger blog, however, it gives an error message of User Name or Password is incorrect. This is because Writer uses an sign-in technology which Google no longer supports. So, here, I will explain how to get your Blogger Blog set up in Writer.</p>

<h1 id="1-download-this">1. Download this:</h1>

<p>There is an open-source fork of Windows Live Writer called Open Live Writer. Newer versions of it aren’t yet verified by Google, but a slightly older version is still supported. To download it, click <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uh9getd6zwkcjhy/AABjxsjEjpyi9n-WHRskp-Y1a?dl=0">here</a>. Run it to install the version of Open Live Writer which supports Blogger. When done running it, open the app from the start menu.</p>

<h1 id="2-set-up-blogger">2. Set up Blogger</h1>

<p>1. When you get to the setup wizard, select “Google Blogger”. Click Next.</p>

<p>2. It will have a button that says “Sign in”. Press it.</p>

<p>3. It will open a browser window where you will sign in with your normal Google Account that you use for Blogger.</p>

<p>4. It will ask you to give Open Live Writer some Google Account permissions. Click Allow.</p>

<p>5. It will then close the tab and you will go back to the app.</p>

<p>6. If you have multiple blogs, it will ask you to choose which one to set up.</p>

<p>7. It will then download the blog to your computer.</p>

<p>8. It will ask you to send a temporary blog post so that it can download the editing theme. Click yes.</p>

<p>Then, you’ll be able to edit your blog from Open Live Writer!</p>
