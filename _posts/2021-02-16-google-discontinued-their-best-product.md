<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">Ok, what does just the title tell you about this product? Well, I’m still using it, and it’s discontinued. Google normally brings to mind Web Services, but how can one still use a Web Service? Well, what that means we can infer is that it’s a Desktop App. Also, it’s discontinued, and I think it’s Google’s best product. Picasa? Nope, this is the much less well known, but very aptly named, drumroll please… </font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">Ok, what the heck is Google Desktop? I hear you ask. Um, well, it’s a Desktop Search tool which also includes a Sidebar with Gadgets. For people still using Outlook 2007, like me, it includes an Outlook indexer which will also display your new emails in a Sidebar Gadget. You can find various Gadgets at the Wayback Machine, with Gadgets such as Outlook to-do and Microsoft Office App Launcher. Some download sites still offer it, but be careful as they may package malware, so download at your own risk. The indexer is pretty good, as it not only indexes the titles, but also the content. It’s pretty sad that Google discontinued it, but being a Desktop app, people still get to use it. Are YOU still using Google Desktop? Let me know in the comments below! </font>
