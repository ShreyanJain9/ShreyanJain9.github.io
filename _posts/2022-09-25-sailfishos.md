As of now, if you‚Äôre going out to buy a phone, it may feel like there is suffocatingly little choice: you can either trade in your money for an Android or commit yourself to an iPhone. But many of us have always wanted a third option in the mobile device market: a third OS that you can install and use on a smartphone. Well, it exists; but unfortunately you‚Äôve probably never heard of it.

Until now.

Introducing Sailfish OS.

Born from the ashes of the once-great Nokia, a small company known as Jolla is responsible for producing Sailfish OS. I tested it on a Sony Xperia 10 III, which is a nice device with no notch, a headphone jack, and a tool-free SIM tray that also lets you expand the storage with a microSD card. A decent device, to say the least. But the reason I chose this device in particular was because it‚Äôs one of the very few devices which runs Sailfish OS. Afterwards, I purchased a license for Sailfish X ‚Äì the name for the user-installable version of Sailfish OS ‚Äì and flashed the zip files to the phone‚Äôs storage. The process is similar to installing an Android ROM like LineageOS, if you‚Äôve ever done that.

Sailfish OS has a user interface which is definitely very unique. It‚Äôs satisfying enough to be a daily driver for somebody like me, due to its ability to install and run Android apps in addition to native apps. Of course, the native apps are much nicer than the Android ones when available, due to one major feature of Sailfish OS which is quite novel when compared to other OSes.

This feature is called the Pulley Menu by the Sailfish developers. It‚Äôs quite useful for using the phone one-handed, which Sailfish OS excels at in general. When in an app, if you over-scroll the top or bottom, you will get a menu of options, and you can pull and hold until you reach the one you want. Then you let go once you‚Äôve highlighted the option you want. This is much more efficient than unnaturally reaching your hand up to find a button.

Unlike on a traditional mobile OS, the Home Screen, rather than showing shortcuts to apps and widgets, show a relevant ‚Äúcard‚Äù for every app you have open. These cards contain relevant information, such as the number of unread messages for the default SMS app. In addition, to get to the the Home Screen, rather than swiping from the bottom, you swipe from the sides.

On either side of the Home Screen resides the Events View, a feed containing the weather, your calendar events, your notifications, and ‚Äì wait for it ‚Äì your Twitter timeline.

Overall, it‚Äôs a very solid alternative to Android and iOS. While I would only recommend it to those extremely enthusiastic about alternative mobile OSes, personally, I find it makes for a good daily driver.

That‚Äôs all üôÇ
