<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">I recently had access to a computer running OS X Yosemite and Google Chrome, and I opened Chrome for a minute, and observed that there was a banner at the top, with the following text:</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3"></font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">“This computer is running OS X 10.10. To receive future Google Chrome updates, please upgrade to OS X 10.11.”</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">The Google Chrome website also now lists 10.10 alongside the already unsupported 10.6 – 10.9, expanding that to 10.6 – 10.10 and listing it as a frozen version.</font>

 <font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3"> However, the Yosemite version of Chrome is still the current version, there will be no future updates. It is safe to assume that Chrome support will continue on Yosemite until this version is outdated. OS X Yosemite is falling behind and this is just one sign. By 2023, OS X Yosemite will probably seem ancient, something it does not seem quite yet. Chrome freezing updates will soon leave Yosemite users without a suitable browser. Funny how the Mac timeline seems to move so much faster than the Windows one – Windows 7 is way older than OS X 10.10 and Chrome still hasn’t frozen updates for it yet.
