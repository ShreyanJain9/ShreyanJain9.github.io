In this post, we’ll be covering how to install Microsoft Office on a Chromebook as a Progressive Web App. Before you get started, we should mention that it’ll feel like a Microsoft Office desktop experience… right up to the moment you actually open a file. Then it’ll just open it in a new Chrome tab. Microsoft very recently disabled the Microsoft Office Android Apps from working on Chromebooks. Microsoft really wants you using Office for the Web on Chromebooks. But, without further ado, let’s dive into it!

Just watch the video below to see me install Microsoft Office on a Chromebook. The video will also show me using the app a little, and displaying some things you can do with it. Alternatively, I’ve provided written instructions beneath the video.

Now, click “sign in” and sign in to your Microsoft Account. If you don’t already have an account, click “Sign up for the free version of Office” and create your Microsoft Account. Once you’ve logged in, you should see the Office Portal. Now, wait for about 20 seconds, then look for this icon in your URL Bar:
