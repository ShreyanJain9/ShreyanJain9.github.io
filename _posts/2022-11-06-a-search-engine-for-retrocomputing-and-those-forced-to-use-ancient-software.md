Are you into retrocomputing? Are you stuck in a situation where you have to use ancient computers, with equally ancient browsers? If so, well, you need a search engine, don’t you? Hmm… most search engines these days are quite heavy on JavaScript and CSS which breaks in these old browsers. Google lets you access its mobile versions in these browsers, but the user experience is significantly compromised, not to mention just plain ugly.

So I (with some help) cobbled together a search engine which is good at one thing, and one thing only. It works where these others do not. It’s essentially a proxy to Bing’s API using a clean, simple, and uncluttered UI. It has one job – to display search results. It doesn’t track you or show you ads. And it’s currently located at <https://tenbluelinks.net>.
