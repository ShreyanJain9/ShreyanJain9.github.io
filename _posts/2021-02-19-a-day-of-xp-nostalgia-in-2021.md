<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">Yep, it’s exactly what it sounds like. Yes, I know this blog is called Tech Terrain TODAY, but I decided to take a blast to the past for a little bit of XP fun. It’s definitely not easy to use WinXP now, but here’s a look at how it went for me anyway. </font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3"></font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">First things first: once I booted up the XP machine, I was greeted with an error message about fax client software, which I dismissed. Then, I decided to theme it to look like Mac OS X. That meant using Flyakite OSX. Now, I guess it’s sort of not in the spirit of the experiment to just make the whole thing feel like a Mac, but then, it is still XP, so that means that it’s really just theming. Ok, enough about theming. </font>

<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande";">Next step: what software is there? Well, luckily for me, this was a used computer. That meant there were still goodies like Office 2003 and Adobe Acrobat 8 lying around on this PC. Of course, it didn’t help much. All my Word docs are in OneDrive, and there’s no way to access OneDrive on the ancient Windows XP. And even if I could, Word 2003 is not compatible with the modern DOCX format. So, that was a disappointment already. </span>

<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande";">By now I got annoyed by the Mac theme so I uninstalled it. The next step was to try to read my email. So, I opened Outlook Express (Yes, Outlook Express!) and tried for a bit, to no avail, to connect to my Outlook email account. Ok, that didn’t work. It honestly didn’t seem like I could use the Windows XP for one entire day. </span>

<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande";">Next step: try to open a Web Site. I mean, if nothing else, maybe I could just surf the web a little? Oh, wait. IE6 isn’t compatible with any modern sites. Yeah, sorry. Still, I might have a little bit of luck here, because being a used device, it uses the slightly newer IE7. Better than nothing. But even IE7 is, as one can expect, bad at site compatibility. Unlike IE6, though, it’s able to load the download page for Google Chrome. That itself is incredible. </span>

<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande";">So, naturally, I download Chrome, because the last version of Chrome to run on XP was released in 2016 –basically, 10 years newer than IE7, and 15 years newer than IE6. Opening Chrome from the Start Menu is easy enough, but the first problem appears immediately. Even the ever-compatible Google homepage apparently has a… certificate issue? The problem is with the PC, because all of the PC’s certificates have expired. And, to make matters worse, Google uses HSTS, which means that there isn’t even an option to bypass the error. And the search/address bar uses Google, too, so that was a big bust. I went to Chrome settings and changed it to Bing. </span>

<span style="font-family: "Lucida Grande";">Searching on Bing actually worked, So that’s another reason why Bing is better than Google, but anyway, I found a download of the old DOS game Zork, Downloaded it, and ran it under Command Prompt. I played Zork for a while, and then decided to play a game of Minesweeper. At this, somebody came up to the XP and cleared the whole board. The conclusion that this made me come to was that the only thing that an XP is good for is DOS gaming.</span>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">A little after that I decided to go back to browsing. So I was naturally shocked when I found the famous Chrome Dino Game. I played it for about 5 minutes while Network Diagnostics ran on the side. Incredible. </font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">I spent about 15 minutes trying to connect to the internet before Windows XP bluescreened and I had to boot in Safe Mode. After rebooting in Normal Mode only to find Dial-Up popups that always failed to use a nonexistent modem appear every time I tried to do something needing the Internet, I unplugged the Wireless Adapter (Yes, that’s how old the PC is) and officialy gave up. By now I was pretty much DONE, so I looked up towards -the clock. Guess how much time I was on this XP before I gave up. It all adds up to a grand total of… </font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">Yeah. </font>
