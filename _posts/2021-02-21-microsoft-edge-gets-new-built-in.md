<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">The world’s best browser, Microsoft Edge, now has the built-in ability to view Microsoft Office files, like DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX files. This is similar to how most major browsers can display PDF files. Also, Microsoft Edge includes PDF viewing abilities, but now, it can display your Office files as well. Note that this feature is currently only available in the Canary version, and will probably come to the mainstream version of Edge in Edge 91. It only appears to be available to some insiders at this point, but if you do have Edge Canary, check under Edge Downloads settings and you may just be lucky enough to see THIS: ![Edge Office Viewer](https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2021/02/edge-office-viewer.png)</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">Still, it may or may not show up for you, because Microsoft seems to still be testing this feature internally, not even letting many Insiders see it. Here’s an example document opened in Edge: ![Word Document Edge](https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2021/02/word-document-edge.png)</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">It looks a bit similar to the online version of Word. However, there are no editing capabilities, and there are three simple commands: Download, Save a copy to OneDrive, and Print. We are eagerly waiting to find out more about this! What do YOU think? Do you think this feature could give the browser a competive EDGE???</font>
