So, you’ve decided that you want to try out an alternative OS on your mobile phone. Maybe you use Ubuntu on your computer and like the idea of having it on your phone. Or maybe you’re just bored of the monotony of Android and want to venture into the world of alternative mobile operating systems. Just be warned: you won’t have any major apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, or YouTube on your Ubuntu Touch phone, and hardware feature support is also limited. In addition, MAKE SURE YOUR PHONE IS ON THE [SUPPORTED DEVICES LIST](https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/) before attempting the process, or you will brick your phone. So don’t say I didn’t warn you, and let’s get into how to do it.

To download the installer, go to <https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/installer/> and select the right download for your computer. In this guide, I used a Mac.

For Windows, you should download the fastboot USB drivers for your phone. Depending on your phone, the process will differ. If you have a Google Pixel device, download it from <https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb>. For most other manufacturers, you can find the drivers at <https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers>.

Now, use a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer. Use the charging port on your phone to do so.

The UBPorts installer should automatically detect your device, but if it doesn’t, just select your device manually.

The wizard from here on is pretty self-explanatory, and it varies so much from device to device that it is not worth covering. But, if you follow everything the installer says exactly right, then you will soon in your hands have a working Ubuntu Touch smartphone!
