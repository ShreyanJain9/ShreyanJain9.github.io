<span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Is this reminiscent of the recent post about using Windows XP in 2021? Well, it should be. This time, though, I’m firing up a 2006 MacBook that I recently received from an acquaintance. Lucky for me, it was already running Mac OS X Snow Leopard. So no install disk needed, thank goodness. Just in case, though, I had an iso file ready from <http://archive.org/details/SnowLeopardInstall>. Anyway, I created a user for myself, deleted the old user, and decided to get comfortable.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 13px;">Hmmm… well, Snow Leopard is one of those old OSes that has a loyal following. A following loyal enough to backport compatibility with the modern web back to Mac OS X Snow Leopard in the form of a browser called InterWeb, which happens to just be a backport of the Firefox 60 ESR with compatibility furthered a little. It’s compatible enough that I was fairly satisfied with my browsing experience on Snow Leopard. It opened Google Drive without a problem, and the Google Docs editing experience was the same as what we’ve come to expect on modern platforms. The experience is very conductive, and it’s been good enough that I’ve switched entirely to the Mac as my main computer. And, the software selection is better. All my friends are on Google Hangouts, and Google Hangouts is fortunately backwards-compatible with Google Talk. So, I install Adium, and add my GTalk account to it. That’s nice. I have the MarsEdit 3 free trial installed on this right now – going to buy when it seems viable. Like the Windows XP, this computer also has a lot of licensed software on it from the previous user – Microsoft Office 2011, Adobe Photoshop CS5, Toast Titanium 11, and VMWare Fusion, just to cite a few (don’t expect me to actually be using VMWare Fusion on THIS – it only has 2 GB of RAM.) Unfortunately, this computer has an i386 processor, being the original MacBook, so no 64-bit software for me. </span></span>

<span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Overall, Mac OS X Snow Leopard is actually a lot more usable 12 years later than you’d expect. On June 8, 2021, Mac OS X 10.6 turns 12 years old – and it’ll still be usable. Amazing, isn’t it? And the best part is that this fits right in with the idea that if a computer can get the job done for you, it doesn’t matter how old it is, it just works. You don’t need a new one – I don’t, at least. And the user interface is *beautiful*. 3D Dock, translucent fabric-y menubar, Mac OS X Aqua (remember that?), and just plain *UI Consistency*. It is so refreshing to use this after suffering in the dump of modern stuff for so long. In fact, that Snow Leopard should compare *favorably* to Big Sur shows how good this operating system is. This was the last version to include many of the “power user” features which made the old Mac OS X so great. Oh, and let me just take a jab at Windows here – why does a 15-year old MacBook with 2 GB RAM, a 55 GB HDD, and a 12-year old version of the Mac OS feel more usable than my 6-month old HP PC with 12 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, a TouchScreen, and Windows 10 20H2 on it? And macOS Big Sur isn’t much better either – whose idea was the ugly new interface? Anyway, enough ranting. Signing off, Shreyan Jain. At least for now, this 15-year old MacBook can be my main computer. </span></span></span>
