<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">On January 14th, 2020, Microsoft officially ended support for Windows 7. Now, it’s January 14th, 2021. A year has passed, and Windows 7 shows no sign of dying. However, if you are still using Windows 7, then you really need to upgrade. Thing is, it’s actually really easy. There’s no real reason to hold out on the update. Any apps that ran on your Windows 7 should run just fine on Windows 10! Media Center holdout? Yes, you can [<font color="#0000ff"><u>run WMC on Win10</u></font>](https://terrenly.com/2021/01/using-windows-media-center-on-windows-10.html). Meanwhile, you should likely upgrade, because most major browsers are soon to end support for Win7. </font>

# <font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande">How to Upgrade</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">While Microsoft’s free upgrade period ended in 2016, it’s actually still perfectly usable from the link below: [<font color="#0000ff"><u>https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</u></font>](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209 "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209").</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">This utility will open up, and then all you have to do is accept the license agreement and select “Upgrade this PC Now” and click next. From here on, you should have no trouble upgrading your PC to Windows 10. </font>

# <font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande">What are the stats? </font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">The stats are quite positive. According to the United States Government Digital Analytics Program, when support ended for that ancient OS, 75.8% of PCs were running Windows 10, while 18.9% were were still holding on to Windows 7. Admittedly, Windows 7 seemed to be on the path to becoming the next Windows XP, but a much more positive outlook is shown by the stats at the end of 2020. At this point, Windows 10 has gone up 12%, to 87.8%, while Windows 7 has dropped by 10%, to 8.5%. Win7 is disappearing. Still, don’t think that it’s any closer to dying. I mean, look at Windows XP. Although tiny now, it is still alive. </font>

# <font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande">Apps dropping support</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Lucida Grande" size="3">Indeed, Windows 7 users will soon find themselves without too many supported apps. The fall of Windows 7 is going a lot faster than the fall of WinXP. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge will both stop supporting Windows 7 on July 15, 2021. Win7 users are truly running out of time. </font>
